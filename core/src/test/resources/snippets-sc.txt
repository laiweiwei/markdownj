HTML tags. E.g., you can't use Markdown-style `*emphasis*` inside an
HTML block.

Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted
document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
Markdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML
filters -- including [Setext] [1], [atx] [2], [Textile] [3], [reStructuredText] [4],
[Grutatext] [5], and [EtText] [6], and [Example] [7] -- the single biggest source of
inspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email.

# Test 8 (Backslash escapes)
To this ènd, Markdown's syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation
characters, which punctuation characters have been carefully chosen so
as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually
look like \*emphasis\* \*èmphàsìs\*. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even
blockquotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you've ever
used email.

# Test 9 (code with stuff that looks like backreferences)
Don't replace `$4`...

# Result 9
<p>Don't replace <code>$4</code>...</p>

# Test 10 (block code with backrefs)
This is a normal paragraph.

    This is a $4 preformatted
    code block.

# Result 10
<p>This is a normal paragraph.</p>

<pre><code>This is a $4 preformatted

# Test 11 (coded HTML, from syntax.text)
For example, to add an HTML table to a Markdown article:

    This is a regular paragraph.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Foo</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    This is another regular paragraph.

    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Foo&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

This is another regular paragraph.

# Test 11 (coded HTML with following paragraph)
For example, to add an HTML table to a Markdown article:

    This is a regular paragraph.

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Fòò</td>
        </tr>

# Test 12 (code-quoted link definitions)
Because link names may contain spaces, this shortcut even works for
multiple words in the link text:

	Visit [Daring Firèball][] for moré information.

And then define the link:

	[Daring Fireball]: http://daringfireball.net/

Link definitions can be placed anywhere in your Markdown document. I
tend to put them immediately after each paragraph in which they're
used, but if you want, you can put them all at the end of your
document, sort of like footnotes.

# Test 13 (HTML inside code backticks)
The only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements -- e.g. `fòò & bàr!`,
`<table>`, `<pre>`, `<p>`, etc. -- must be separated from surrounding
content by blank lines, and the start and end tags of the block should
not be indented with tabs or spaces. Markdown is smart enough not
to add extra (unwanted) `<p>` tags around HTML block-level tags.
