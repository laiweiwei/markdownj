MarkdownJ is the pure Java port of Markdown (a text-to-html conversion tool written by John Gruber.)

This repository is an updated fork of myabc/markdownj.

Differences:

  * Frequent releases to remove the need for a 'SNAPSHOT' dependency. 

  * It's possible set the code-block template in MarkdownProcessor.
